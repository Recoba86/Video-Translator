# 🎯 Using Google AI Studio (Gemini API)

## Perfect! You have Google AI Studio access!

This is **BETTER** than the original Google Cloud setup because:
- ✅ **Simpler** - Just one API key
- ✅ **Cheaper** - Much lower costs
- ✅ **Easier** - No billing setup needed initially
- ✅ **Generous Free Tier** - More free usage

---

## Quick Setup (2 minutes!)

### Step 1: Get Your API Key

1. Go to: **https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey**
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API Key"** or **"Get API Key"**
4. Copy the API key (starts with `AIza...`)

### Step 2: Add to Your Project

```bash
cd /Users/amin/Documents/Witamin-Game/Video-Translator/Video-Translator

# Add your API key to .env
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza..." >> .env
```

Or edit `.env` manually:
```env
# Add this line:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# You can comment out or remove the Google Cloud line:
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./google-credentials.json
```

### Step 3: Install Required Package

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Gemini SDK
pip install google-generativeai
```

That's it! Much simpler than Google Cloud setup!

## What About Audio Transcription?

Gemini doesn't directly process audio YET, so we have two options:

### Option A: Use Whisper (FREE, runs locally)
**Recommended for you!**

```bash
# Install Whisper
pip install -U openai-whisper
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Completely FREE
- ✅ Runs on your computer
- ✅ No API costs
- ✅ Good accuracy

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires more CPU/RAM
- ⚠️ Slower on older computers

### Option B: Keep Google Speech-to-Text
Use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for transcription, Gemini for translation

**Pros:**
- ✅ Faster
- ✅ More accurate
- ✅ Better timestamps

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires Google Cloud setup
- ⚠️ Small cost after free tier

---

## Recommended Setup: Whisper + Gemini

This is the **best option** for you:
- ✅ Whisper (FREE) for transcription
- ✅ Gemini (cheap) for translation
- ✅ No Google Cloud setup needed!
- ✅ Total cost: ~$0.01 per video

---

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Install required packages
pip install google-generativeai openai-whisper

# 2. Add to requirements.txt
echo "google-generativeai==0.3.2" >> requirements.txt
echo "openai-whisper==20231117" >> requirements.txt

# 3. Add your API key to .env
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> .env
```

## Cost Comparison

### Your Setup (Whisper + Gemini):
- Whisper: **FREE** (local)
- Gemini: **$0.00025** per 1000 input chars, **$0.0005** per 1000 output chars
- **10-minute video**: ~$0.01
- **100 videos/month**: ~$1

### Original Setup (Google Cloud):
- Speech-to-Text: $0.024/minute (60 min free)
- Translation: $20/million chars (500k free)
- **10-minute video**: ~$0.26
- **100 videos/month**: ~$26

## Gemini Free Tier

Google AI Studio includes:
- **15 requests per minute** (RPM)
- **1 million tokens per minute** (TPM)
- **1,500 requests per day**

This is MORE than enough for personal use!
