# ✅ TASK CANCELLATION FEATURE - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Task Cancellation**
The system now automatically cancels background video processing tasks when:
- User closes the browser tab
- User refreshes the page during processing
- User navigates away from the page

### 2. **Browser Warning Before Leaving**
When processing is active, users see a confirmation dialog:
```
پردازش ویدئو در حال انجام است. آیا مطمئن هستید؟
Video processing in progress. Are you sure?
```

### 3. **New API Endpoint**
- **`POST /api/cancel/<task_id>`**: Cancels a running task

### 4. **Backend Task Management**
- Tasks are tracked with their Celery task IDs
- Tasks are terminated using `SIGKILL` for immediate termination
- Temporary files are automatically cleaned up
- Task status is updated to 'cancelled'

## 📝 Code Changes

### **app.py**
- Added `active_connections` tracking dict
- Added `cancel_video_task()` endpoint
- Updated `check_status()` to track active connections
- Import `cancel_task` from tasks module

### **tasks.py**
- Added `celery_task_ids` tracking dict
- Store Celery task ID when task starts
- Added `cancel_task()` function:
  - Revokes task with `terminate=True`
  - Cleans up temp files
  - Updates status to 'cancelled'

### **script.js**
- Added `isProcessing` state variable
- Added `beforeunload` event listener (shows warning)
- Added `visibilitychange` event listener (cancels when tab hidden)
- Added `unload` event listener (backup cancellation)
- Added `cancelTask()` function using `navigator.sendBeacon`
- Handle 'cancelled' status in UI

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Task Cancellation Flow**
```
1. User closes tab/refreshes page
2. JavaScript detects event (beforeunload/visibilitychange)
3. Sends POST to /api/cancel/<task_id>
4. Flask calls cancel_task(task_id)
5. Backend revokes Celery task
6. Cleanup temp files
7. Update status to 'cancelled'
```

### **Why `sendBeacon`?**
- `sendBeacon` is designed for sending data during page unload
- Guaranteed delivery even if page is closing
- Non-blocking (doesn't delay page navigation)
- Fallback to `fetch` with `keepalive: true` for older browsers

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Resource Efficiency**
   - No orphaned tasks consuming CPU/memory
   - No wasted Gemini API calls
   - Temp files cleaned up immediately

2. **Cost Savings**
   - Gemini API calls stopped when user leaves
   - Saves money on unnecessary translations

3. **Better UX**
   - Clear warning before losing work
   - System behaves predictably
   - No confusion about background processes

4. **Server Health**
   - No zombie processes
   - Clean temp directory
   - Better system monitoring

## 📊 Testing

### **Test Scenario 1: Close Tab**
1. Start video processing
2. Close browser tab
3. ✅ Task should be cancelled
4. ✅ Temp files should be deleted

### **Test Scenario 2: Refresh Page**
1. Start video processing
2. Click refresh
3. ✅ Warning dialog should appear
4. ✅ If confirmed, task cancelled

### **Test Scenario 3: Navigate Away**
1. Start video processing
2. Try to navigate to another page
3. ✅ Warning dialog should appear
4. ✅ If confirmed, task cancelled

### **Test Scenario 4: Complete Successfully**
1. Start video processing
2. Wait for completion
3. ✅ No warning when closing after done
4. ✅ isProcessing = false

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### **Check Celery Logs**
```bash
tail -f logs/celery.log
```
You should see:
- Task received
- If cancelled: Task terminated

### **Check Flask Logs**
```bash
tail -f logs/flask.log
```
You should see:
- POST /api/cancel/<task_id> requests

### **Check Temp Directory**
```bash
ls -la temp/
```
Should be empty or contain only active tasks

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### **Potential Future Improvements**
1. **Persist task IDs in localStorage**
   - Allow recovery after accidental refresh
   - Show "Resume" option

2. **Add "Cancel" button in UI**
   - Manual cancellation without closing tab
   - Better user control

3. **WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates**
   - More efficient than polling
   - Immediate cancellation detection

4. **Task queue management**
   - Prevent multiple simultaneous tasks
   - Queue system for busy times

5. **Progress persistence**
   - Save checkpoint states
   - Resume from last checkpoint

## 📚 Documentation Updated

- ✅ Created `USAGE.md` with complete guide
- ✅ Explains new cancellation behavior
- ✅ Troubleshooting section
- ✅ Best practices

## ✨ Summary

The video translator now intelligently manages resources by:
- **Detecting** when users leave the page
- **Warning** users before they lose their work
- **Cancelling** background tasks automatically
- **Cleaning up** temporary files immediately

**Result**: More efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly system! 🎉
